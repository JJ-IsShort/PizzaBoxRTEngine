# PizzaBoxRTEngine
An unfinished project. This was my first C++ project. I tried to make a raytracing first game engine inspired by Archean. I got as far as using hardware accelerated raytracing to render a triangle using the Vulkan API, but then decided the design of the game engine needed reworking. I will come back to this idea and try and improve it, but next time, it will be in Zig.
